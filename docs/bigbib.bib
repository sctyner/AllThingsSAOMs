	abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

@article{Watts98,
abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

@article{latentspace,
abstract = {Network models are widely used to represent relational information among interacting units. In studies of social networks, recent emphasis has been placed on random graph models where the nodes usually represent individual social actors and the edges represent the presence of a specified relation between actors. We develop a class of models where the probability of a relation between actors depends on the positions of individuals in an unobserved social space. We make inference for the social space within maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and propose Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures for making inference on latent positions and the effects of observed covariates. We present analyses of three standard datasets from the social networks literature, and compare the method to an alternative stochastic blockmodeling approach. In addition to improving on model fit for these datasets, our method provides a visual and interpretable model-based spatial representation of social relationships and improves on existing methods by allowing the statistical uncertainty in the social space to be quantified and graphically represented.},

 abstract = {The idea of data augmentation arises naturally in missing value problems, as exemplified by the standard ways of filling in missing cells in balanced two-way tables. Thus data augmentation refers to a scheme of augmenting the observed data so as to make it more easy to analyze. This device is used to great advantage by the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) in solving maximum likelihood problems. In situations when the likelihood cannot be approximated closely by the normal likelihood, maximum likelihood estimates and the associated standard errors cannot be relied upon to make valid inferential statements. From the Bayesian point of view, one must now calculate the posterior distribution of parameters of interest. If data augmentation can be used in the calculation of the maximum likelihood estimate, then in the same cases one ought to be able to use it in the computation of the posterior distribution. It is the purpose of this article to explain how this can be done. The basic idea is quite simple. The observed data y is augmented by the quantity z, which is referred to as the latent data. It is assumed that if y and z are both known, then the problem is straightforward to analyze, that is, the augmented data posterior p(θ ∣ y, z) can be calculated. But the posterior density that we want is p(θ ∣ y), which may be difficult to calculate directly. If, however, one can generate multiple values of z from the predictive distribution p(z ∣ y) (i.e., multiple imputations of z), then p(θ ∣ y) can be approximately obtained as the average of p(θ ∣ y, z) over the imputed z's. However, p(z ∣ y) depends, in turn, on p(θ ∣ y). Hence if p(θ ∣ y) was known, it could be used to calculate p(z ∣ y). This mutual dependency between p(θ ∣ y) and p(z ∣ y) leads to an iterative algorithm to calculate p(θ ∣ y). Analytically, this algorithm is essentially the method of successive substitution for solving an operator fixed point equation. We exploit this fact to prove convergence under mild regularity conditions. Typically, to implement the algorithm, one must be able to sample from two distributions, namely p(θ ∣ y, z) and p(z ∣ θ, y). In many cases, it is straightforward to sample from either distribution. In general, though, either sampling can be difficult, just as either the E or the M step can be difficult to implement in the EM algorithm. For p(θ ∣ y, z) arising from parametric submodels of the multinomial, we develop a primitive but generally applicable way to approximately sample θ. The idea is first to sample from the posterior distribution of the cell probabilities and then to project to the parametric surface that is specified by the submodel, giving more weight to those observations lying closer to the surface. This procedure should cover many of the common models for categorical data. There are several examples given in this article. First, the algorithm is introduced and motivated in the context of a genetic linkage example. Second, we apply this algorithm to an example of inference from incomplete data regarding the correlation coefficient of the bivariate normal distribution. It is seen that the algorithm recovers the bimodal nature of the posterior distribution. Finally, the algorithm is used in the analysis of the traditional latent-class model as applied to data from the General Social Survey.},

abstract = {A model for network panel data is discussed, based on the assumption that the observed data are discrete observations of a continuous-time Markov process on the space of all directed graphs on a given node set, in which changes in tie variables are independent conditional on the current graph. The model for tie changes is parametric and designed for applications to social network analysis, where the network dynamics can be interpreted as being generated by choices made by the social actors represented by the nodes of the graph. An algorithm for calculating the Maximum Likelihood estimator is presented, based on data augmentation and stochastic approximation. An application to an evolving friendship network is given and a small simulation study is presented which suggests that for small data sets the Maximum Likelihood estimator is more efficient than the earlier proposed Method of Moments estimator.},

abstract = {We introduce a network visualization technique that supports an analytical method applied in the social sciences. Policy network analysis is an approach to study policy making structures, processes, and outcomes, thereby concentrating on relations between policy actors. An important operational concept for the analysis of policy networks is the notion of centrality, i.e., the distinction of actors according to their importance in a relational structure. We integrate this measure in a layout model for networks by mapping structural to geometric centrality. Thus, centrality values and network data can be presented simultaneously and explored interactively.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the study of networks has increased dramatically. Researchers from across the sciences, including biology and bioinformatics, computer science, economics, engineering, mathematics, physics, sociology, and statistics are more and more involved with the collection and statistical analysis of network-indexed data. As a result, statistical methods and models are being developed in this area at a furious pace, with contributions coming from a wide spectrum of disciplines. This book provides an up-to-date treatment of the foundations common to the statistical analysis of network data across the disciplines. The material is organized according to a statistical taxonomy, although the presentation entails a conscious balance of concepts versus mathematics. In addition, the examples including extended cases studies are drawn widely from the literature. This book should be of substantial interest both to statisticians and to anyone else working in the area of network science.'},
