# Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models for Longitudinal Network Data: Removing the Blindfold

As this is the least-developed section of my thesis, this section will describe the work I intend to do in as much detail as possible. 

## Introduction

The introduction to this chapter will primarily serve as a brief introduction to the structure of stochastic actor-oriented models (SAOMs) for longitudinal network data. As there is a greater exposition of these models in the literature review, I do not repeat that information here at this time. 

## Visualizing the Dynamic Network Process

The basis for SAOMs is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that remains entirely unobserved with the exception of the finite number of network observations, $T \geq 2$.  The first part of this chapter will discuss a to-be-developed procedure to visualize the intermediary steps in the Markov chain that lead to the network transformation from one time point to another. This video (or interactive app ?) will clearly demonstrate the multilevel process the SAOMs are modelling. First, it will show that a node is selected and given the opportunity to change a tie, and then it will show how that node's objective function decides which tie to change, or to not change at all. 

## Characterizing a SAOM

My hope is that this demonstration will also raise some important questions in the minds of researchers working with these social network models and others. Primarily, I hope to bring question of the model *distribution* to the forefront. The process being modeled is random, and as such has a theoretical underlying distribution. What does that distribution look like? This is an open question in statistical network analysis. In statistics, the entity being modeled is assumed to have an underlying distribution according to any level complexity of model. Even in situations of analytical intractability, data can be simulated in some way or another in order to give the researcher an idea of what the distribution of the model looks like. These distributions can be viewed with histograms or barcharts, or with contour plots, heat maps, or 3D plots for higher dimensional data. But none of these statistical graphics are appropriate for most network models, including SAOMs. Thus, I will aim to create a way to, given various parameter values, visualize the distribution of a SAOM. One area which I will explore to accomplish this task is principal component analysis for graph data. 

Once a distribution is characterized and viewable, the next things people notice are what the average value from this distribution looks like and how spread out the distribution is. Therefore, my next task will be to come up with a way to compute and view the "average" network from a given SAOM, as well as some measure of variability so that researchers can more easily determine whether or not an observed network or set of networks could possibly have come from a given model.
